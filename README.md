## MTE 100 Fishing robot project

Worked in a team of 4 to create an automated fishing robot prototype made from LEGO and powered by a LEGO EV3 controller and motors. 
#### Problem 
Fishing takes a long time for those who use it as a source of work, and the main movements of fishing can be automated in a portable robot in order to allow a fisherman to increase their output of fish or do other tasks while fishing.
Existing solutions to increase output require buying larger vessels and using nets, which increases the risk of overfishing.

#### Solution



The basic movements of fishing, such as casting, waiting for feedback from a fish, and subsequently reeling the fish back, could be automated using motors and sensors. Therefore, the team decided to automate fishing, both because of the uniqueness of creating a robot that can fish, and its ability to use a variety of sensors needed to automate this task.
