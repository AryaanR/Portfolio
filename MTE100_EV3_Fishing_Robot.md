## MTE 100 LEGO EV3 Fishing robot project TEST

Worked in a team of 4 to create an automated fishing robot prototype made from LEGO and powered by a LEGO EV3 controller and motors. 
### Problem 
Fishing takes a long time for those who use it as a source of work, and the main movements of fishing can be automated in a portable robot in order to allow a fisherman to increase their output of fish or do other tasks while fishing.
Existing solutions to increase output require buying larger vessels and using nets, which increases the risk of overfishing.

### Solution

Fishing Robot: An automated fishing robot that mimics the movements of a human fishing such as casting, waiting for line feedback, and reeling fish using motors and sensors

### Key Features

- Replicates complex human fishing motions through five distinct automated functions - casting, reeling, vertical adjustment, horizontal rotation, and reset capabilities.
- Gearbox Mechanism: Dynamically disengages the reeling system during casting through a rack and pinion actuator.
- Modular subsystems: Modular systems for casting, reeling, and positioning functions, allowing for unit testing during building and programming.
- Control System: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors, gyro, and motor encoders to perform actions, with an interactable interface to choose how to use robot. 
  
### Impact for Employers

- Showcases skill in building a complete robotic system from concept to completion
- Demonstrates aptitude to program features for real-time systems
- Highlights ability to both productively work and lead a team
